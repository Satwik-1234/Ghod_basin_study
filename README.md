# Integrated Hydrological Analysis Repository

**Rainfall Trend Analysis & Sedimentation Assessment of Ghatghar and phagulgavhan RRGP project 

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository presents an **integrated hydrological and river engineering analysis framework** developed using Python and Google Colab.
The work combines **climate-driven rainfall trend assessment** with **field-relevant sedimentation analysis** of **Loose Boulder Structures (LBS)** and **Gabion structures**, commonly used in watershed management and river training works.

The repository is designed to support:

* Hydrological investigations
* Watershed and river management studies
* Dam safety and flood-related assessments
* Academic research and technical reporting

## 🔍 Study Components

### 1️⃣ Rainfall Trend Analysis

This module focuses on **long-term rainfall variability and trend detection** using daily rainfall time-series data.

**Key objectives:**

* Identify long-term rainfall trends
* Detect increasing or decreasing rainfall patterns
* Support hydrological design and flood assessment studies

**Methods applied:**

* Time-series visualization
* Mann–Kendall trend test
* Sen’s slope estimator
* Statistical summary of rainfall behavior

📌 *This analysis provides the climatic context for sediment transport and structural performance.*

### 2️⃣ Sedimentation Analysis of LBS and Gabion Structures

This module evaluates **sediment deposition behavior upstream and downstream of LBS and Gabion structures**, which are widely used in:

* Watershed development works
* Soil and water conservation
* Stream stabilization

**Key objectives:**

* Quantify sediment accumulation near structures
* Assess effectiveness of LBS and gabions in sediment retention
* Understand sediment transport response to rainfall variability

**Methodology includes:**

* Field-based sediment measurement data
* Rainfall–sediment relationship analysis
* Comparative sediment deposition assessment
* Graphical and statistical interpretation

📌 *This analysis links rainfall-driven runoff processes with structural sediment trapping performance.*
