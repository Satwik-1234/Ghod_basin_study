## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains an **integrated hydrological analysis** carried out under the **RRGP context**, combining:

* **Rainfall Trend Analysis** using long-term weather data
* **Sedimentation Volume Estimation** for **Loose Boulder Structures (LBS)** and **Gabion Structures** based on field measurements

The repository is structured to support **engineering review, academic assessment, and professional documentation**, with clear separation of **data, analysis, outputs, and reports**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

* Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)
* Matplotlib (engineering-quality plots)
* PyMannKendall (trend analysis)
* Google Colab
* Field-survey–based sediment measurements

---

## 🎯 Key Outcomes

* Identification of rainfall variability and long-term trends
* Quantitative sediment volume estimation for LBS and Gabion structures
* Engineering-ready calculations for RRGP and watershed studies
* Clear documentation linking rainfall behavior with sediment deposition

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Assumptions

* Rainfall data quality directly affects trend reliability
* Sedimentation estimates are based on measured cross-sections
* Linear variation of sediment between sections is assumed

Detailed assumptions are documented within individual analysis notebooks and READMEs.
